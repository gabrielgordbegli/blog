            What if there existed a drug that caused you to be transported to another world, full of beauty and wonder? Or maybe, this drug could cause you to lose your sense of self, and become immersed in a gripping story. How about a pill that would allow you to inhabit someone's mind, and start thinking their thoughts?

            This third variation of this hypothetical pill is what you ingested when you started reading this article. The second is what you took the last time you watched a film, and the first is what you will have taken when virtual reality reaches its full potential.

            Sometimes I wonder. If an activity was only accessible on the other side of a pill, how would society treat it differently? Conversely though, many states of mind associated with drugs may also be available sober. Consider the runner's high, buddhist's nirvana, or even the stoic's joy.
